# Voice-Controlled Home Automation Bot

## Objective
To design and implement a voice-controlled home automation system that
controls devices like lights and fans using spoken commands.

## Problem Statement
Traditional switches require manual operation. This project provides
a hands-free solution using voice commands for home device control.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- SpeechRecognition API
- PyAudio
- ROS (conceptual)
- Webots (conceptual simulation)

## System Architecture
Voice Input → Speech Recognition → Command Parser → Actuator Module → Device Control

## Implementation
The system captures voice input using a microphone, converts speech to text,
parses commands, and triggers corresponding actions for home devices.
Device control is simulated using console output.

## Results
The system successfully responds to voice commands such as:
- "Light on"
- "Light off"
- "Fan on"
- "Fan off"

## Future Scope
- Integration with ROS publishers and subscribers
- Smart home simulation using Webots
- Hardware implementation using ESP32 or Arduino
